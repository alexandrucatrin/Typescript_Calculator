# TypeScript Calculator

This TypeScript calculator allows you to perform various mathematical operations from the command line. Before you get started, make sure you have Node.js and the TypeScript compiler installed. If you don't have them, you can download and install them from the following links:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Installation

1. After installing Node.js and TypeScript, open a terminal.

2. Run the following commands to initialize your project and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   npm install typescript readline-sync

3. Run the TypeScript compiler to transform the TypeScript code into JavaScript:

   ```bash
   tsc calculator.ts

  This will generate a calculator.js file.

4. Run the calculator using Node.js:
